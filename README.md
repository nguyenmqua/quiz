# quiz
The objective of this project was to create a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions that would run on the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. The app  will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The criteria of the projects was when the start clicks, a timer would start and a question would appear. When I answer that question, if I got it correct a point was added. If it was wrong, time would be taken off. Then at the end of the game, either timed out or the end of questions, a scoreboard would populate.
